Step 1: Initialize a dictionary frequency with keys from 1 to 6 (representing die face values), and set each value to 0.

Step 2: Loop through each number in the input list rolls:

If the number is between 1 and 6 (inclusive), increment its count in the frequency dictionary.

If the number is not between 1 and 6, print a warning message indicating an invalid die roll.

Step 3: After processing all rolls, print the frequency of each die face from 1 to 6 in a formatted output.
